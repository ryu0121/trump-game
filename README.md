# Objective
The primary reason why I created this app is to learn the foundation of MVC architecture and practice OOP programming paradigm.

# Point
The point that I focused on when I created this app, is down below.
 ## Open/Closed
 I had an intention of using Duck Typing and I was trying to integrate interface to open extension and  close modification.
 ## Single Responsibility
 I was trying to make each methods have only one reason why it'll be changed.
 ## Delegation
 I was also trying to send message to object. It's not programming like procedural programming, but object oriented programming.
